[JS, HTML, CSS] CheatLoverz website login source leaked by CODEX#0317 &amp; Dre–∞m#0001

this is the real html page, cheatloverz pasted the source of masterpasta, they doesn't even use any PHP but they use HTML and a backend (JS).
OFC we can't get their backend so me & masterpasta decided to make a simple login included and compatible with this source.



# HOW TO USE
```js
  if(username == "exampleusername" && password== "examplepassword")
   {
    window.location.replace("https://dash.cheatloverz.com/panel");
   }
```
# paste this = monkey
this is not the real source at all and a fucking terrible remake
